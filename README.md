# ShareIt! - Pure Javascript Peer to Peer filesharing

P2P filesharing application running inside the web browser.
No install, no config, no problems: just ShareIt! ;-)

Jesús Leganés Combarro "Piranna" - [piranna@gmail.com]

ShareIt! is a "Peer to Peer" filesharing system written in pure Javascript that
runs inside your web browser like a normal web page that don't need servers
thanks to [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) technology.

This project was finalist for the [OpenITP](http://openitp.org)'s first round of
2013 project funding and is currently candidate for the spanish national
[Universitary Free Software Championship](http://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org/1213)
2013.

If you will fork the project (and more if you want to do modifications) please
send me an email just to let me know :-)

## About

File transfers in ShareIt! is build over WebRTC PeerConnection [DataChannels]
(http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html#rtcdatachannel) so they could
be transfered directly between peers. Currently it's being used an encrypted
[DataChannel polyfill](https://github.com/piranna/DataChannel-polyfill) using
secure WebSockets, but in the near future (version 2.0) they will be used native
DataChannels, making it perfect for anonymity. You can take a preview on branch
[Chromium_v28](https://github.com/piranna/ShareIt/tree/Chromium_v28).

Source code from [DirtyShare](https://github.com/Miserlou/DirtyShare)
proof-of-concept by Rich Jones (rich@[gun.io](http://gun.io)) was used as basis
for the initial stages of development.

Let's make a purely browser based, ad-free, Free and Open Source private and
anonymous distributed filesharing system!

## How to test it

The webapp is designed to be fully client side, so files can be served by any
static web server or web hosting. If you have Python installed they can be
served directly from the project folder using

> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

so the webapp will be available on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You
can also host it on [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/help/201/en) if desired.
It is currently publicly hosted on

* [5Apps]  (https://5apps.com/demos/piranna/shareit)
* [GitHub] (http://shareit-project.github.io/ShareIt)
* [DropBox](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/je1wmwnmw0lbae2/ShareIt!/index.html)
(development, cutting-edge instance. It would not work...)

The peer connections are managed by an external handshake channel. Currently is
being used [Jappix](https://jappix.com) anonymous XMPP server and it's being
researched to use some more standard and distributed handshake protocols in an
anonymous way. Previously it was being used the [PubNub](http://www.pubnub.com)
pubsub platform, and the [SimpleSignaling]
(https://github.com/piranna/SimpleSignaling) server using a test server hosted
on Nodejitsu, but now althought maintained they are deprecated and it's
recommended to don't use this centralized, single-point-of-failure platforms.

You can test it locally opening two browser tabs, but it should work also if
used between several machines if there are no symetric NATs on both ends (it was
succesfully tested to transfer files through the wild Internet from Finland to
Spain... :-) ). Due to its architecture, it can work between tabs launched from
different domains, too.

## Compatibility

Because of the usage of DataChannel polyfile, currently it's only compatible
with Chromium v23, v24 & v25 due to incompatible changes on the PeerConnection
API on higher versions. You can find portable versions for Windows (and on Linux
using Wine) at [SourceForge]
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Google%20Chrome%20Portable/Additional%20Versions)
. Later, you'll need to enable the RTCPeerConnection support on the
[chrome://flags](chrome://flags) panel, and after that you'll be able to run
ShareIt! sucessfully.

Experimental (and working! :-D ) support for native DataChannels is available on
[Chromium_v28](https://github.com/piranna/ShareIt/tree/Chromium_v28) branch
using the [reliable](https://github.com/michellebu/reliable) library due to
current limitations on Chromium native DataChannels, although is terrible slow.
It's spected that native reliable support will be available in the next weeks.
